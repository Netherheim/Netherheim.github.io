    <h1>Scope:</h1>
    <h2>3.1 The Unity Game Engine:</h2>
    <p>When it comes to a 2D game like ours, the Unity game engine is a perfect fit. Since its launch in 2005, Unity has
        become a house-hold name for game development, particularly in the indie scene. Unity offers a multitude of
        features especially relevant in our project such as sprite editing, animation, scripting,…. Alongside its
        beginner-friendly development interface, Unity’s wealth of community tutorials makes it a great place for
        novices like us to work on 4 the game. Therefore, we have chosen Unity as the primary development platform for
        the project. </p>
    <h2>3.2 Rogue-like Mechanics: </h2>
    <p>Rogue-like games are role-playing games with heavy emphasis on replayability and difficulty. The most prominent
        feature of a rogue-like is how its challenging combat system makes players fail repeatedly, forcing them to
        adapt and improve their play-style after each failure. As with many other rogue-likes, defeat in our game is not
        the end. In fact, being defeated in a level offers the player a chance to improve their performance for future
        playing sessions in the home menu. During the adventure, players can collect gold coins, which can be spent to
        upgrade either the player’s character or the tower after the player has died in a level. After successfully
        clearing a level, the player is rewarded with various items to aid them in even harder levels. </p>
    <h2>3.3 Player Movement and Combat:</h2>
    <p>We, as a team, are huge fans of the 2D rogue-like genre. Therefore, our player combat and movement systems draw
        inspiration from classics like Enter the Gungeon, Hades, and The Binding of Isaac. For the movement system, we
        want to cultivate a sense of freedom and fluidity. Players should be able to explore the fantastic maps to their
        heart’s content. They will be able to move, run and dash through keyboard inputs (i.e. W, A, S, D keys and arrow
        keys). As for the combat system, we want players to immerse themselves through a fluid, responsive and natural
        style of input. With mouse inputs, our player combat system will have 360 degrees of freedom. This means the
        player will be able to fight, shoot, and use special skills in any direction they desire.</p>
    <h2>3.4 Weapons and Loot:</h2>
    <p>Collecting powerful weapons and useful items to aid the adventurer in increasingly challenging levels is at the
        core of our game’s replayability. Therefore, it is important to have a wide variety of interesting and unique
        collectibles throughout the game.
        Weapons are categorized into three main groups: melee, ranged and magic. Melee weapons are ones with relatively
        short range, but make up for it with high attack power. These weapons encourage an aggressive,
        high-risk-high-reward playstyle. Ranged weapons have lower damage but better range, which makes for a more
        tactical style of combat. Magic weapons are usually the most powerful, but players can only use them at the cost
        of mana, a fairly rare resource.
        Items come in a wide variety. These are collectibles meant to aid the player during combat. They include
        anything from health potions which heal the player, mana potions that restore player’s mana, bear traps that
        lock enemy movement, ... .</p>
    <h2>3.5 Enemies:</h2>
    <p>“The more successful the villain, the more successful the picture”, said Alfred Hitchcock.[3] Similarly, enemies
        have always been one of the most vital parts of a role-playing game. If done right, enemies can not only be a
        fun feature, but also form the basis of a game’s identity. Therefore, it is crucial to create an enemy system
        that pushes players to their limits, challenging them to keep honing their skills. In order to achieve this, we
        want to emphasize the enemies’ mechanics and variety. Mechanically speaking, enemies will be fast-paced and
        aggressive, targeting the player the moment they detect them. The enemies’ strength lies not in intelligence but
        in numbers, forcing the player to utilize the tower mechanics to fight off monstrous hordes. As for diversity,
        enemies in the game will vary according to different maps and difficulties. Currently, we have successfully
        developed a number of enemy types, including: (NEED TO FIX)</p>
    <h2>3.6 Maps: </h2>
    <p>Our game is heavily influenced by other top-selling 2D games on the market such as Hades, Vampire Survivors,
        Hotline Miami and Corekeeper. However, what these games have in common is top-down camera view. With this game’s
        perspective, the player will be able to see the entire content the map has to offer: what to look for, where the
        enemies are and the treasure locations. Our game utilized this camera technique to complement with a map layout
        inspired by Diablo II, where the player will have to survive in vast wildlands and explore the many dungeon’s
        floors. However, this will not turn the game into a casual, easy-mode RPG. Instead, your character will have to
        fight for their lives against the relentless hordes of monsters and undead alike in a large filthy swamp.</p>
    <h2>3.7 Towers:</h2>
    <p>Roguelike RPG games are widespread among the gaming industry. That is why we decided to add a unique feature to
        stand out from the crowd which is towers. Taking inspiration from well-known tower defense games such as Kingdom
        Rush and Bloons TD, we design a number of built-in AI towers that can detect enemies that are in a specific
        range and damage them with a wide range of projectiles. This feature will be useful for the player to fight
        against the enemies that are slowly increasing in number as the level progresses. Additionally, there is a timer
        for each tower symbolizing the time that it is able to stay active. Therefore a maintenance and upgrade system
        is also added for the player to prevent the tower from deactivating. The purpose of this feature is to create a
        more engaging style of gameplay and 7 stimulate the player’s problem solving skills as there are now a variety
        of ways you can use your resources to beat the levels along with higher risks of losing as the difficulty
        increases. </p>
