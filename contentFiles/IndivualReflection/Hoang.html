            <li><strong>Email address:</strong> s3978452@rmit.edu.vn</li>
            <li><strong>Interest and skills:</strong> Hoang is a person who takes challenges as delightful experiences. He
                knows that he is just like a normal person and would one day give up on a much too difficult journey. But he
                also acknowledges to himself that nothing is better than beating the overwhelming and ecstasy of mastery.
                And Unity sure is a great challenge to him.</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Hoang individually designs the scenes and terrains of the project. He builds the
                generating system of maps as well. Writing and fixing proposals and reports are also his responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career Plans:</strong> Hoang is inspired by technology and technology alone. Anything that relies on
                technology is what he wishes to learn. However, he will accomplish them one by one and not get overwhelmed.
                A.I technology is his current goal before choosing another path.</li>
        </ul>
