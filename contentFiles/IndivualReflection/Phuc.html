    <h1>Nguyen Trong Tien</h1>
    <p>Since my childhood, I have deeply been fond of games, as well as wondered how they were created. Coming to this
        course, I had a chance to learn about game developing with the team myself. My role was to create enemies, who
        would then become great challenges to the player. Fortunately, I have always been a big fan of fantasy novels
        such as The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, Neil
        Gaiman’s novels, movies as Avatar of James Cameron, etc; I also picked up good designs from other games, so I
        believed I had a good imagination of evil creatures being counterweight to the hero. However, my problems came
        from actualizing those ideas. I had very few knowledge of C#, the language used in Unity, and it was likewise
        tough to find sprites for my characters as the given sprites could not be suitable for my team’s vision of the
        game’s setting. Thankfully, after support from my teammates, self-learning, I finally got rid of the problem and
        was successful with the darkside army and ignited my interest in A.I. technology. During the process, I could
        draw out several benefits from getting used to game development, teamworking, and most importantly making
        decisions on my unclear future purpose. After this project, I expect more opportunities to study deeper in
        Artificial Intelligence, which is my chosen minor, and games and get ready for my career earlier.
