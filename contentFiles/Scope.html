    <p>Our video game is still in the early stages of production, as such, many crucial features are still missing. In
        the future we would need many more talents to make the game a complete product. If we could get a team of 4
        competent individuals for the project, here are the positions we will be looking for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sound Designer: One of the most lacking aspects of the game so far is sound design. Our lack of experience
            in this field, along with limited time, meant that the game is very lackluster audio-wise. Therefore, a
            sound designer will be a huge asset to the team, bringing life to the game. As our game is heavily stylized
            with cartoonish pixel art, we would like someone experienced with this type of game, one who can create
            simple yet catchy 8-bit tunes.</li>
        <li>Lead Artist: The game in its current state relies heavily on free assets, which is incredibly hindering to
            the groupâ€™s creative vision. Therefore, it would be extremely beneficial to have a competent artist that can
            turn our ideas into reality. Ideally, we are looking for an artist with experience in pixel art, one who can
            create beautiful and original assets for the game. Another important criteria is communication, the lead
            artist must have strong communication skills to accurately reflect what the team wants to achieve.</li>
        <li>Lead Programmer: Our game currently still has many bugs and inefficiencies that prevents it from being a
            great product. As such, we need a skilled programmer on the team to guide us along technical issues. The
            most important criteria is that the Lead Programmer has to be well-versed with Unity, the current game
            engine. This candidate also needs strong communication, teamwork and mentorship skills in order to aid
            members during development.</li>
        <li>PR Manager: The most difficult part of making a successful indie game is marketing. Getting people to notice
            and play our game will be next to impossible without someone in the field of marketing. As a result, we need
            a PR Manager that has experience promoting video games. They would need to be good at marketing on multiple
            media platforms. Of course, communication skills are crucial to the position, but the candidate will only
            not be communicating with us, they will need to interact with the fan community, listening and responding to
            their comments of the game. </li>
    </ul>
