                As a team of video game enthusiasts, we thrive
                to make a mark in the gaming scene. Our ambition is to create a 2D Unity role-playing game set in
                the enticing theme of dark fantasy, mixing the traditional features of rogue-like games with
                brand-new ideas. We want to create a product that offers unique gameplay, high replayability, and
                most importantly, an enjoyable experience.

                A clear line of communication between members is not only efficient, but also vital to the success of any group project. Thus, the key to the success of our project relies on consistent and organized communication via multiple platforms that are well-fitted for the tasks at hand. To that end, we have settled on four primary means of exchanging information: Face-to-face meetings, Facebook Messenger, Discord, and Github

                The scope of our project is to build a rogue-like video game with enjoyable content like our
                predecessors. Therefore, it should be obvious that we start small and on the same foot as they did:
                <strong>Unity</strong>.

            <p>
                A dream without a challenge is just a false path to false. We encouter multiple obstacles and as
                well
                as the limits we currently have as immature developers. And as long as there are risks, our team
                will
                always try to find the solutions and break through the stopping points afront us.

                We work as a team but our perspectives and mindsets are not the same as expected. There were conflicts because of the differences in ideologies, yet we managed to pull through. But in the end, the true beauty lies in how each individual sees the world that contribute in the completion of this project.

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Our current game is completely playable with basic functions but misses a lot of function due to the
                lack of manpower and low level of knowledge in terms of the game engine. Therefore, in the future we
                would need many more talents to make the game a complete product. If we could get a team of 4
                competent
                individuals for the project.
