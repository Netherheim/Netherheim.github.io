    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was my introduction to game development and collaborative coding. Therefore, my journey through the
        project was filled with ups and downs. Creating a Unity game requires proficiency in game design, object
        oriented programming and the C# language. Fortunately, learning these skills did not present much problems, as I
        already have a background in computer graphics, which translated very well to game development. However, what I
        struggled with was collaboration. I was surprised by the difficulty of making a piece of software with others.
        Each member’s expectation and vision of the game was different, therefore, many conflicts occurred throughout
        development. To me, the most difficult part was finding a way to resolve these incompatibility issues not only
        in code but also in creative vision. By working through these problems, however, I have gained a better
        perspective of teamwork, and learned how to be a better team player. Hopefully, in the future, I could utilize
        this knowledge to account for our members’ various preferences, making sure that our future project together
        would be more in line with the group’s creative vision.
