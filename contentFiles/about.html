                As a group, we could not be more proud of what we have achieved during the relatively limited time. We
                turned a creative vision into reality with effective collaboration, communication and planning. From the
                very beginning, we have been extremely passionate about the project due to our backgrounds as fervent
                gamers. This is why we decided to make a playable prototype by the end of the project. It is a means to
                prove our efforts and confidence in our ideas. The fact that we successfully developed the prototype
                shows
                how well we worked together, assembling sophisticated systems into a complete package. This would simply
                be
                impossible without dedication from every member of the team.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, the journey that took us here was one riddled with conflicts and hardships. We encountered
                countless troubles with software bugs, incompatibility issues, clashes of creative vision and deadlines
                from
                other courses. One thing that we could do in the future to mitigate these issues is better planning.
                Although we had a decently descriptive timetable for the project, it was simply not detailed enough. A
                more
                specific and organized plan would guide us along the project more smoothly. Another improvement can be
                made
                in the communication aspect. A lot of software incompatibility issues were caused by drastically
                different
                coding schemes of each member. This meant we had to spend a lot of effort to make different systems in
                the
                game work together.
            </p>

                As gamers, we understand how harsh video game development can be. However, as outsiders, it is difficult
                to
                fully appreciate how much dedication it takes just to make a simple game. This fact came as a distinct
                surprise to us in the early stages of the project. Every time we try to add a feature to the game we are
                stunned by the sheer amount of work it takes. Just implementing the player combat alone took days.
                Through
                this experience, we have gained significantly more respect for game developers.

                This project has been eye-opening for us in many ways, particularly when it comes to teamwork. A lot of
                the
                conflicts during development came about as a result of different ideas from across the team. This also
                led
                to much difficulty in software compatibility. We failed to take into account the ideas of every member
                and
                come up with a concept that satisfies all of us. This taught us to consider more about the ideas of each
                individual in a group before finalizing a plan for the project.
