        <li>Unity Hub (Version 3.4.1): we also needed to install a Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.12f1) within this
            application
        </li>
        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 (Version 16.11.20)

    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>When creating a video game, it is extremely important to have extensive player testing to judge the playability,
        enjoyability and objective quality of the game. Therefore, we heavily emphasized testing with outsiders during
        development. Whenever basic mechanics like combat and towers get updated, we let our friends and family try out
        the game and record their response for further improvements. We are primarily looking for responses where people
        find the game fun, fluid and original.
    </p>
    <p>Within the time limit of the project, we could not carry out mass player testing, but that would be a more ideal
        condition for testing, thereby getting a more general and objective view of the game. Ideally, we would launch
        pre-release versions of our game on our own website, then get the responses of our players from there.</p>
    <h2>About communication</h2>
    <p>A clear line of communication between members is not only efficient, but also vital to the success of any group
        project. Thus, the key to the success of our project relies on consistent and organized communication via
        multiple platforms that are well-fitted for the tasks at hand. To that end, we have settled on four primary
        means of exchanging information: Face-to-face meetings, Facebook Messenger, Discord, and Github.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Face-To-Face Meetings:
            <p>A face-to-face meeting offers each member a chance to honestly express their ideas, feelings and concerns
                regarding the project. This is why we have decided to have a face-to-face meeting every week. Ideally, a
                two-hour meeting would be held at the end of each week, at a registered meeting room on campus. Members
                will summarize their weekly progress, participate in discussions for further development, and voice
                their concern over any potential problem. Each member is expected to properly prepare for the meeting,
                show meaningful progress every week, and most importantly, show up on time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Messenger:
                Although face-to-face meetings are effective, their frequency is simply insufficient to keep a
                consistent line of communication across members. To solve this issue, we turn to one of the most popular
                messaging apps in Vietnam, Facebook Messenger. A Messenger group containing all members will be the
                primary way we communicate off-campus. Messenger is the perfect spot for when a member wants to ask
                questions, point out urgent problems, or simply have an informal chat. This can not only help to keep
                all members up-to-date with their teammates, but also cultivate a friendly environment for the project.
                Every member is expected to check the group chat daily to avoid missing any important updates.

                Discord:
                Great though Facebook Messenger is, it still has various drawbacks. The app is not ideal for video
                calls, file-sharing or making official announcements. A better option for these features would be
                Discord – a free communication platform. The team’s Discord server will be the place for voice calls,
                video calls, sharing interesting assets, and important announcements. Each feature will have its
                respective text channel or voice channel, ensuring clear and organized communication. For example, there
                will be a text channel dedicated to announcements, where meeting schedules will be posted. This makes it
                much easier for members to keep track of all the important updates. In addition, Discord’s voice chat
                and video chat features are a great substitute when face-to-face meetings simply are not possible due to
                scheduling.

            <p>Github:
                The final piece of the communication puzzle is a platform for doing version-control, for this we chose
                Github. According to Wikipedia, it is the biggest source code hosting service worldwide, and has more
                than 200 million repositories as of June 2022 [4]. Github’s robust service, coupled with its popularity,
                is why we chose this platform for exchanging source code for our project. A common repository for all
                members will be the home for all of the source code and assets of our Unity project. All members will
                work on the same Unity project. This way, progress between members can be synchronized without any need
                for manually transferring files.</p>
