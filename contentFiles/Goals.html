    <h2>Currently, we have a playable prototype of the game with many core features present:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Player combat and movement:
            <ul>
                <li> The player can be controlled using W, A, S, D keys for movement and the mouse for aiming.</li>
                <li> The player has various attributes including: health that determines whether the player is alive or
                    not;
                    stamina that can be used to either run faster by holding Shift or dash forward by pressing Space;
                    mana that
                    allow the player to use magical weapons.</li>
                <li>
                    <img src="/Pictures/pic1.png" alt="">
                    <img src="/Pictures/pic2.png" alt="">
                    <img src="/Pictures/pic3.png" alt="">
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Item system:
            <ul>
                <li>Weapons: There are currently 3 weapons in the game: Iron Sword, a short-ranged but devastating
                    weapon; Wooden Bow, a long-ranged but relatively weak weapon; Sapphire Staff, a magic weapon that
                    shoots powerful magical orbs but costs mana to use.
                </li>
                <li>Consumables: There are two types of consumable potions: Health Potions (red), and Mana Potions
                    (blue), which recover the respective player’s attribute.
                </li>
                <li>Currency: The main currency of the game are gold coins, which are obtained from killing monsters.
                    These coins can be used to purchase towers.
                </li>
                <li>Inventory System: There are four inventory slots for items the player picks up throughout the level.
                    The player can access each item by pressing the corresponding number key (e.g. “4” key for slot
                    number 4) or scroll the mouse.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><i>In order to achieve our scope, we want to emphasize the enemies’ mechanics and variety. As for
                    diversity, there are five different types of enemy appearing in the game</i>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Melee Enemies: This type of enemy moves toward and attacks the player as soon as they are in the
                    detection zone, their damage and knockback are huge, but the attacking range is limited. They are
                    usually seen as monsters that appear in hordes, such as zombies, skeletons, cobras, ogres, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ranged Enemies: This type assaults the player from a further distance by shooting projectiles and
                    dodging their melee attack, which can also explode upon impact causing damage and knockback force to
                    the player, poison paddles taking the player’s health for several times, or flames having the same
                    effect. In return, these enemies do not have much health. Phantoms, wandering souls, and wyverns
                    belong to this type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hybrid Enemies: They are the combination of the previous two, can attack in both ways, but most of
                    them cannot move and are as vulnerable as the ranged. Slimes and carnivorous plants are major
                    members of this type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Invoker Enemies: A class created specifically for the Invoker, which is typically a ranged enemy,
                    but can frequently summon more creeps to the battlefield. The Invoker usually plays the role of
                    minibosses and drops out rare items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boss Enemies: As for our expectation of a higher difficulty, we created the bosses. Being the
                    toughest obstacles against the player, they get all essences from the others, have both melee
                    attacks and ranged blasts. They are also able to summon clones of themselves and have a strong
                    second phase. Dark assassin is currently our first boss, the others are still in development.
                </li>
                <p><i>All of these enemies are located in suitable places of the map, due to their distinguishing roles
                        and difficulties.</i></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Tower system:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Towers can be purchased and activated at an outpost for 50 gold coins, these outposts are marked
                    with the symbol for 50 gold coins.
                    <img src="" alt="">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Towers will automatically target and shoot at the closest enemy.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Map:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The maps we made are similar to games that require the player to move from one level to another
                    while the difficulty of each one increases. We have them filled with obstacles so that the player
                    will need to pay attention to the surroundings instead of feeling so safe to dodge around multiple
                    times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currently we have one map that represents a Swamp biome for the player to play in and an
                    in-developed dungeon for better combat and adventurous experience instead of being hand-held by the
                    developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We as a team will try to accomplish self-made graphics instead of having assets downloaded from
                    other creators in the future.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            UI:
            <ul>
                <li>Player attribute bars: These are progress bars that represent the player’s health (red), stamina
                    (green) and mana (blue)</li>

                <li>Inventory bar: Shows the various item currently present in the player’s inventory, as well as the
                    currently selected item (the Iron Sword in the image below)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gold counter: Shows how many gold coins the player currently owns
                </li>

                <li>
                    Game Over screen: When the player’ health reaches 0, the Game Over screen appears. To restart the
                    game, simply press “Restart”
                </li>
            </ul>


        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>However, there are still many problems with the game regarding bugs, inefficiency and limitations, including:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inventory system randomly spawning new item when pick up an item.

        </li>
        <li>
            The player sometimes clip through the environment due to problems with collision detection.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no transition between levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lack of consistency when it comes to enemy design (sprite resolution, inheritance structure and coding
            schemes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Lack of audio design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Limited UI functions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>In the future, we would like to amend these major issues with the following measures:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Rewrite and restructure the source code for the inventory system, collision detection and enemy system.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create more original assets like sprites, sounds and music.
        </li>
        <li>Add more UI features like a home menu, setting menu and game-pause menu.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Overall, the current prototype closely matches our original creative vision, with many core elements
            developed. The game offers a certain amount of entertainment value and introduces new ideas to the
            rouge-like genre. However, our game still has many drawbacks that prevents it from being a complete product.
            Hopefully with more time and effort we can bring Netherheim into a finished state.
        </i></p>
