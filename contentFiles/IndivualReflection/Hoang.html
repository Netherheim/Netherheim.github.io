    <h1>Duong Tran Minh Hoang:</h1>
    <p>Working on an IT project and in my case, a video game concept has left me with multiple questions about the
        technology industry and especially its creative department. Indeed, the time and effort I spent on making a
        product with my fellow teammates have taught me more about programming knowledge, self-learning tactics, team
        working spirit, … than any online courses out there. Yet, the project actually inspired me to learn more about
        games development – a path the young me wished to take. However, there are still doubts whether I should
        continue programming specifically for video games or not. The industry is harsh, excessively competitive and
        sometimes even worse for those who do the creative work. They seemingly are less honored than those who
        accomplish logical tasks like creating complex algorithms. The Disney’s abusing their graphics design team
        scandal is worth mentioning. Besides the entertainment, I also have plans to become an A.I engineer – one of the
        top paying positions. I chose it simply because it fascinates me with how much more a computer can accomplish
        rather than the monthly paycheck. Because of this, there had been a constant battle within me as to which one I
        should dedicate my heart to. But in the span of three months, I started to wonder “What can I achieve with A.I
        in a video game?”.
