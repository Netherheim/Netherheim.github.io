        <h2>Basic Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email address:</strong> s3978452@rmit.edu.vn</li>
            <li><strong>Interest and skills:</strong> Hoang is a person who takes challenges as delightful experiences. He
                knows that he is just like a normal person and would one day give up on a much too difficult journey. But he
                also acknowledges to himself that nothing is better than beating the overwhelming and ecstasy of mastery.
                And Unity sure is a great challenge to him.</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Hoang individually designs the scenes and terrains of the project. He builds the
                generating system of maps as well. Writing and fixing proposals and reports are also his responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career Plans:</strong> Hoang is inspired by technology and technology alone. Anything that relies on
                technology is what he wishes to learn. However, he will accomplish them one by one and not get overwhelmed.
                A.I technology is his current goal before choosing another path.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Working on an IT project and in my case, a video game concept has left me with multiple questions about the
            technology industry and especially its creative department. Indeed, the time and effort I spent on making a
            product with my fellow teammates have taught me more about programming knowledge, self-learning tactics, team
            working spirit, … than any online courses out there. Yet, the project actually inspired me to learn more about
            games development – a path the young me wished to take. However, there are still doubts whether I should
            continue programming specifically for video games or not. The industry is harsh, excessively competitive and
            sometimes even worse for those who do the creative work. They seemingly are less honored than those who
            accomplish logical tasks like creating complex algorithms. The Disney’s abusing their graphics design team
            scandal is worth mentioning. Besides the entertainment, I also have plans to become an A.I engineer – one of the
            top paying positions. I chose it simply because it fascinates me with how much more a computer can accomplish
            rather than the monthly paycheck. Because of this, there had been a constant battle within me as to which one I
            should dedicate my heart to. But in the span of three months, I started to wonder “What can I achieve with A.I
            in a video game?”.
