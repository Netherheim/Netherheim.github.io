                As a team of video game enthusiasts, we thrive
                to make a mark in the gaming scene. Our ambition is to create a 2D Unity role-playing game set in
                the enticing theme of dark fantasy, mixing the traditional features of rogue-like games with
                brand-new ideas. We want to create a product that offers unique gameplay, high replayability, and
                most importantly, an enjoyable experience.

            <p>
                The primary aim for the project is creating a rouge-like RPG where we take the player into a world
                of dark fantasy inspired by the Norse mythology and medieval tales. As the player ventures into this
                world, they have to always be on their foot, or otherwise be the sacrifice for the creatures roaming
                the land.

                The scope of our project is to build a rogue-like video game with enjoyable content like our
                predecessors. Therefore, it should be obvious that we start small and on the same foot as they did:
                <strong>Unity</strong>.

                A dream without a challenge is just a false path to false. We encouter multiple obstacles and as
                well
                as the limits we currently have as immature developers. And as long as there are risks, our team
                will
                always try to find the solutions and break through the stopping points afront us.

                Besides the passion for making enjoyable content, we as a team, value the sense of communication
                among
                members. And as modern developers, we are to take use of the contemporary tools that help us achieve
                the
                key for our success.

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Our current game is completely playable with basic functions but misses a lot of function due to the
                lack of manpower and low level of knowledge in terms of the game engine. Therefore, in the future we
                would need many more talents to make the game a complete product. If we could get a team of 4
                competent
                individuals for the project.
