    <p><i>This project has been a memorable and enlightening journey for all of us. It is a rare opportunity for us to
            challenge and improve ourselves. Here are some personal thoughts from each member of the team:</i></p>
    <h2>Personal Reflection:</h2>
    <p><b>Duong Tran Minh Hoang</b><br>
        Working on an IT project and in my case, a video game concept has left me with multiple questions about the
        technology industry and especially its creative department. Indeed, the time and effort I spent on making a
        product with my fellow teammates have taught me more about programming knowledge, self-learning tactics, team
        working spirit, … than any online courses out there. Yet, the project actually inspired me to learn more about
        games development – a path the young me wished to take. However, there are still doubts whether I should
        continue programming specifically for video games or not. The industry is harsh, excessively competitive and
        sometimes even worse for those who do the creative work. They seemingly are less honored than those who
        accomplish logical tasks like creating complex algorithms. The Disney’s abusing their graphics design team
        scandal is worth mentioning. Besides the entertainment, I also have plans to become an A.I engineer – one of the
        top paying positions. I chose it simply because it fascinates me with how much more a computer can accomplish
        rather than the monthly paycheck. Because of this, there had been a constant battle within me as to which one I
        should dedicate my heart to. But in the span of three months, I started to wonder “What can I achieve with A.I
        in a video game?”.</p>

        This project was my introduction to game development and collaborative coding. Therefore, my journey through the
        project was filled with ups and downs. Creating a Unity game requires proficiency in game design, object
        oriented
        programming and the C# language. Fortunately, learning these skills did not present much problems, as I already
        have
        a background in computer graphics, which translated very well to game development. However, what I struggled
        with
        was collaboration. I was surprised by the difficulty of making a piece of software with others. Each member’s
        expectation and vision of the game was different, therefore, many conflicts occurred throughout development. To
        me,
        the most difficult part was finding a way to resolve these incompatibility issues not only in code but also in
        creative vision. By working through these problems, however, I have gained a better perspective of teamwork, and
        learned how to be a better team player. Hopefully, in the future, I could utilize this knowledge to account for
        our
        members’ various preferences, making sure that our future project together would be more in line with the
        group’s
        creative vision.</p>

        Since my childhood, I have deeply been fond of games, as well as wondered how they were created. Coming to this
        course, I had a chance to learn about game developing with the team myself. My role was to create enemies, who
        would
        then become great challenges to the player. Fortunately, I have always been a big fan of fantasy novels such as
        The
        Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, Neil Gaiman’s novels,
        movies as Avatar of James Cameron, etc; I also picked up good designs from other games, so I believed I had a
        good
        imagination of evil creatures being counterweight to the hero. However, my problems came from actualizing those
        ideas. I had very few knowledge of C#, the language used in Unity, and it was likewise tough to find sprites for
        my
        characters as the given sprites could not be suitable for my team’s vision of the game’s setting. Thankfully,
        after
        support from my teammates, self-learning, I finally got rid of the problem and was successful with the darkside
        army
        and ignited my interest in A.I. technology. During the process, I could draw out several benefits from getting
        used
        to game development, teamworking, and most importantly making decisions on my unclear future purpose. After this
        project, I expect more opportunities to study deeper in Artificial Intelligence, which is my chosen minor, and
        games
        and get ready for my career earlier.</p>
    <p><b>Tran Phan Trong Phuc</b><br>
        As a young student who aspired to learn more about AI and its industry, I was blessed to have an opportunity to
        do a
        group project about information technology in this course. However, it was still a big challenge for me at the
        beginning as I did not have much knowledge to take on game development in comparison to my teammates – for
        example,
        how game development works?, how to use unity or code with C#?, etc. Surprisingly, with the helping hands of my
        smart teammates, I was still able to learn all these concepts and contribute to this project effectively. This
        journey really made me in awe of how powerful working in a team can be since our group has achieved so much in
        just
        a span of 3 months. Even though we have encountered many kinds of issues relating to ideas, insights, and
        technical
        problems, each member has put in the effort to solve every problem for the sake of the group, which is why I
        have so
        much respect for my teammates. This project has really helped me not only to bring me a step closer to my career
        path but also to grow as a person. In the future, I would embrace more opportunities to do group projects to see
        what else I can accomplish with this new-found knowledge and skills.</p>
    <h2>Group Reflection:</h2>
    <p>As a group, we could not be more proud of what we have achieved during the relatively limited time. We turned a
        creative vision into reality with effective collaboration, communication and planning. From the very beginning,
        we
        have been extremely passionate about the project due to our backgrounds as fervent gamers. This is why we
        decided to
        make a playable prototype by the end of the project. It is a means to prove our efforts and confidence in our
        ideas.
        The fact that we successfully developed the prototype shows how well we worked together, assembling
        sophisticated
        systems into a complete package. This would simply be impossible without dedication from every member of the
        team.</p>
    <p>Of course, the journey that took us here was one riddled with conflicts and hardships. We encountered countless
        troubles with software bugs, incompatibility issues, clashes of creative vision and deadlines from other
        courses.
        One thing that we could do in the future to mitigate these issues is better planning. Although we had a decently
        descriptive timetable for the project, it was simply not detailed enough. A more specific and organized plan
        would
        guide us along the project more smoothly. Another improvement can be made in the communication aspect. A lot of
        software incompatibility issues were caused by drastically different coding schemes of each member. This meant
        we
        had to spend a lot of effort to make different systems in the game work together.</p>
    <p>As gamers, we understand how harsh video game development can be. However, as outsiders, it is difficult to fully
        appreciate how much dedication it takes just to make a simple game. This fact came as a distinct surprise to us
        in
        the early stages of the project. Every time we try to add a feature to the game we are stunned by the sheer
        amount
        of work it takes. Just implementing the player combat alone took days. Through this experience, we have gained
        significantly more respect for game developers.</p>
    <p>This project has been eye-opening for us in many ways, particularly when it comes to teamwork. A lot of the
        conflicts during development came about as a result of different ideas from across the team. This also led to
        much
        difficulty in software compatibility. We failed to take into account the ideas of every member and come up with
        a
        concept that satisfies all of us. This taught us to consider more about the ideas of each individual in a group
        before finalizing a plan for the project.</p>
