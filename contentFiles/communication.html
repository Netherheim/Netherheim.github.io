    <h1>Face-To-Face Meetings</h1>
    <p>A face-to-face meeting offers each member a chance to honestly express their ideas, feelings and concerns regarding the project. This is why we have decided to have a face-to-face meeting every week. Ideally, a two-hour meeting would be held at the end of each week, at a registered meeting room on campus. Members will summarize their weekly progress, participate in discussions for further development, and voice their concern over any potential problem. Each member is expected to properly prepare for the meeting, show meaningful progress every week, and most importantly, show up on time.</p>
    <h1>Messenger</h1>
    <p>Although face-to-face meetings are effective, their frequency is simply insufficient to keep a consistent line of communication across members. To solve this issue, we turn to one of the most popular messaging apps in Vietnam, Facebook Messenger. A Messenger group containing all members will be the primary way we communicate off-campus. Messenger is the perfect spot for when a member wants to ask questions, point out urgent problems, or simply have an informal chat. This can not only help to keep all members up-to-date with their teammates, but also cultivate a friendly environment for the project. Every member is expected to check the group chat daily to avoid missing any important updates.</p>
    <h1>Discord</h1>
    <p>Great though Facebook Messenger is, it still has various drawbacks. The app is not ideal for video calls, file-sharing or making official announcements. A better option for these features would be Discord – a free communication platform. The team’s Discord server will be the place for voice calls, video calls, sharing interesting assets, and important announcements. Each feature will have its respective text channel or voice channel, ensuring clear and organized communication. For example, there will be a text channel dedicated to announcements, where meeting schedules will be posted. This makes it much easier for members to keep track of all the important updates. In addition, Discord’s voice chat and video chat features are a great substitute when face-to-face meetings simply are not possible due to scheduling.</p>
    <h1>Github</h1>
    <p>The final piece of the communication puzzle is a platform for doing version-control, for this we chose Github. According to Wikipedia, it is the biggest source code hosting service worldwide, and has more than 200 million repositories as of June 2022 [2]. Github’s robust service, coupled with its popularity, is why we chose this platform for exchanging source code for our project. A common repository for all members will be the home for all of the source code and assets of our Unity project. All members will work on the same Unity project. This way, progress between members can be synchronized without any need for manually transferring files.</p>
