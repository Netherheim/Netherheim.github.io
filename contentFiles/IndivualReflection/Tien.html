    <h1>Tran Phan Trong Phuc</h1>
    <p>As a young student who aspired to learn more about AI and its industry, I was blessed to have an opportunity to
        do a group project about information technology in this course. However, it was still a big challenge for me at
        the beginning as I did not have much knowledge to take on game development in comparison to my teammates â€“ for
        example, how game development works?, how to use unity or code with C#?, etc. Surprisingly, with the helping
        hands of my smart teammates, I was still able to learn all these concepts and contribute to this project
        effectively. This journey really made me in awe of how powerful working in a team can be since our group has
        achieved so much in just a span of 3 months. Even though we have encountered many kinds of issues relating to
        ideas, insights, and technical problems, each member has put in the effort to solve every problem for the sake
        of the group, which is why I have so much respect for my teammates. This project has really helped me not only
        to bring me a step closer to my career path but also to grow as a person. In the future, I would embrace more
        opportunities to do group projects to see what else I can accomplish with this new-found knowledge and skills.
