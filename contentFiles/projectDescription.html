    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <h2 class="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>As a team of video game enthusiasts, we thrive to make a mark in the gaming scene. Our ambition is to create a 2D
        Unity role-playing game set in the enticing theme of dark fantasy, mixing the traditional features of rogue-like
        games with brand-new ideas. We want to create a product that offers unique gameplay, high replayability, and
        most importantly, an enjoyable experience.</p>
    <p>We wish to create a lasting impression with players of our game, one that differentiate us from the multitude of
        other games in the same genre. The game has to offer a creative twist on pre-established standards of the
        rouge-like genre. In order to do so, we need a team that understands and has passion for gaming. Fortunately,
        our team has what it takes.</p>
    <p>There are several reasons why we chose video games for our project. One could clearly observe how prominent the
        gaming industry has become over the years. <a
            href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p06036760/Gaming-Market-Growth-Trends-COVID-19-Impact-and-Forecasts.html?utm_source=GNW">“The
            Gaming Market was valued at USD 198.40 billion in 2021, and it
            is expected to reach a value of USD 339.95 billion by 2027.”</a> Games are no longer a simple mode of
        entertainment for the common person, but a reliable source of income for millions. Such is the influence of
        video games that they have become cultural symbols. For example, prominent franchises like Pokémon and Mario are
        almost unanimous with this era’s entertainment. Furthermore, working on a video game provides us with a variety
        of skills including programming, UI design and problem solving. These skills will prove invaluable to our future
        career in IT. However, the primary reason why we decided to make a video game is simply because we are extremely
        passionate gamers. Our team are massive fans of the roguelike genre, and have spent countless hours grinding
        away at these games. Therefore, we have a basic understanding of what makes these types of games fun, and how to
        freshen up the genre. </p>
    <p>Indeed, the roguelike genre has become super popular over the years, spawning dozens of successful titles like
        “Hades”, “Dead Cells” and “Enter the Gungeon”. Breaking into this scene is rather difficult as it is quite
        oversaturated. Therefore, it takes an original and well-executed twist on the genre to really stand out. For
        this twist, we looked at a genre that is almost the opposite of the high-paced action of rouge-like: the tower
        defense genre. By incorporating the tactical element of tower defense games, we can make a more engaging and
        original experience for our players.</p>
    <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
    <h3 class="aim">Aims</h3>
    <p>The primary aim for the project is creating a rouge-like RPG. An RPG (Role Playing Game) is a genre of video
        games where the player assumes the roles of characters in a fictional setting. In our case, this setting is
        fantasy, taking inspiration from Norse mythology and medieval tales. Rogue-like is a sub-genre of RPG, with an
        emphasis on fast-faced, difficult combat and high replayability. The rouge-like genre has come to dominate the
        indie scene over the years. It has gathered a massive fanbase, with millions of players constantly on the
        lookout for new ideas. Our team is also a part of this fanbase, each member with hundreds of hours poured into
        titles like “The Binding of Isaac”, “Hades” and “Dead Cells”. Therefore, we understand the genre and know what
        new ideas to bring to the table.</p>
    <p>As with many other rogue-likes, the combat system is the definitive feature of the game. After all, fighting
        monsters is what players spend the majority of their time doing in these games. Therefore, it is a major goal of
        the project. We want the combat to feel fast, fluid and intuitive. The player should feel challenged, but always
        wanting to try again after every failure.</p>
    <p>Another goal for the project is setting. A memorable gaming experience must immerse its player into its world. We
        can achieve this through two means: the map and the enemies. The map provides the background, a subtext to the
        world of our game. The enemies enriches the world, making it more lively and believable.</p>
    <p>The final, and most important, goal is putting a creative spin on the rouge-like genre. To make the gameplay
        standout, we needed a unique mechanic. To this end, we took inspiration from the tower defense genre. Tower
        defense is a sub-genre where the goal is to defend a player's territories using automatic turrets. Rouge-like
        games are often fast-paced with very little tactical thinking. By incorporating the tactical element of the
        tower defense genre, the game will offer a more engaging and challenging experience.</p>
