    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <h2 class="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>As a team of video game enthusiasts, we thrive to make a mark in the gaming scene. Our ambition is to create a 2D
        Unity role-playing game set in the enticing theme of dark fantasy, mixing the traditional features of rogue-like
        games with brand-new ideas. We want to create a product that offers unique gameplay, high replayability, and
        most importantly, an enjoyable experience.</p>
    <p>We wish to create a lasting impression with players of our game, one that differentiate us from the multitude of
        other games in the same genre. The game has to offer a creative twist on pre-established standards of the
        rouge-like genre. In order to do so, we need a team that understands and has passion for gaming. Fortunately,
        our team has what it takes.</p>
    <p>There are several reasons why we chose video games for our project. One could clearly observe how prominent the
        gaming industry has become over the years. <a
            href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p06036760/Gaming-Market-Growth-Trends-COVID-19-Impact-and-Forecasts.html?utm_source=GNW">“The
            Gaming Market was valued at USD 198.40 billion in 2021, and it
            is expected to reach a value of USD 339.95 billion by 2027.”</a> Games are no longer a simple mode of
        entertainment for the common person, but a reliable source of income for millions. Such is the influence of
        video games that they have become cultural symbols. For example, prominent franchises like Pokémon and Mario are
        almost unanimous with this era’s entertainment. Furthermore, working on a video game provides us with a variety
        of skills including programming, UI design and problem solving. These skills will prove invaluable to our future
        career in IT. However, the primary reason why we decided to make a video game is simply because we are extremely
        passionate gamers. Our team are massive fans of the roguelike genre, and have spent countless hours grinding
        away at these games. Therefore, we have a basic understanding of what makes these types of games fun, and how to
        freshen up the genre. </p>
    <p>Indeed, the roguelike genre has become super popular over the years, spawning dozens of successful titles like
        “Hades”, “Dead Cells” and “Enter the Gungeon”. Breaking into this scene is rather difficult as it is quite
        oversaturated. Therefore, it takes an original and well-executed twist on the genre to really stand out. For
        this twist, we looked at a genre that is almost the opposite of the high-paced action of rouge-like: the tower
        defense genre. By incorporating the tactical element of tower defense games, we can make a more engaging and
        original experience for our players.</p>
    <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
    <h3 class="aim">Aims</h3>
    <p>The primary aim for the project is creating a rouge-like RPG. An RPG (Role Playing Game) is a genre of video
        games where the player assumes the roles of characters in a fictional setting. In our case, this setting is
        fantasy, taking inspiration from Norse mythology and medieval tales. Rogue-like is a sub-genre of RPG, with an
        emphasis on fast-faced, difficult combat and high replayability. The rouge-like genre has come to dominate the
        indie scene over the years. It has gathered a massive fanbase, with millions of players constantly on the
        lookout for new ideas. Our team is also a part of this fanbase, each member with hundreds of hours poured into
        titles like “The Binding of Isaac”, “Hades” and “Dead Cells”. Therefore, we understand the genre and know what
        new ideas to bring to the table.</p>
    <p>As with many other rogue-likes, the combat system is the definitive feature of the game. After all, fighting
        monsters is what players spend the majority of their time doing in these games. Therefore, it is a major goal of
        the project. We want the combat to feel fast, fluid and intuitive. The player should feel challenged, but always
        wanting to try again after every failure.</p>
    <p>Another goal for the project is setting. A memorable gaming experience must immerse its player into its world. We
        can achieve this through two means: the map and the enemies. The map provides the background, a subtext to the
        world of our game. The enemies enriches the world, making it more lively and believable.</p>
    <p>The final, and most important, goal is putting a creative spin on the rouge-like genre. To make the gameplay
        standout, we needed a unique mechanic. To this end, we took inspiration from the tower defense genre. Tower
        defense is a sub-genre where the goal is to defend a player's territories using automatic turrets. Rouge-like
        games are often fast-paced with very little tactical thinking. By incorporating the tactical element of the
        tower defense genre, the game will offer a more engaging and challenging experience.</p>
    <h3 class="aim">Plans and Progress</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of this assignment, we quickly formed a group of 4 as each member has known each other since high school, then booked a meeting room at the library to start planning for this project, all within the first week of its announcement. Our goal for this project was to create something creative yet simple. Many different ideas were discussed during this meeting, but the three most popular choices were a finance website, AI, and game development. Since learning and implementing the first two ideas to a project is too difficult for a group of first-year students without prior experience, not to mention with a short amount of time. Therefore game development felt at home even though it is still quite challenging. After the meeting, we started to do individual research into these concepts before making the final decision on what path we should take.
    </p>

    <p>Following the research progress, we have all agreed to take on game development and begin to plan out the project development and timetable in week 2. The group progressed very well in the first two weeks of the plan, we had finished developing the basics of player and enemy mechanics and then successfully combined them to test basic functions like combat and health. However, due to the unfamiliarity in the university setting compared to high school, the project’s progress was hindered by ineffective preparation for other assignments at the time, one of which was writing the report for early feedback in the Intro to Information Technology course. As a result, the tower’s mechanics and additional enemies are still in development while the time for developing other individual features along with quality proof and testing was delayed to weeks 5 - 6.        
    </p>

    <p>
        As we are slowly reaching halfway through this project timeline, it was decided that the task that must get done was to make the complete prototype of the game with just the main components. Subsequently, the tower system was quickly finalized, then together with the new version of the map integrated into the game to start testing and polishing the final product. Even though we have minimized the impact of last month’s setback, we also had to simultaneously handle a different assignment namely the Micro:bit project in a different course. Hence not only some features such as boss-type enemies and the design of the user interface can only be completed in the following month but the contents of week 8 were also removed as a consequence of time pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the last month of this journey, all eyes were set to finish the prototype before week 11’s presentation. Unfortunately, we encountered several conflicts with C# code scripts and some files in the game during the process of adjusting the individual features to work together via committing and pushing to our GitHub repository, some of which we have never seen before when using GitHub. Eventually, all problems were solved and the prototype was debugged, polished, and ready for display. With the remaining time, we were able to carry out the plan as intended.
In general, the majority of the goals set out for this project were achieved despite the difficulties we faced during the first two months. Well-thought-out changes to the timetable were made in order to get the most important tasks done – for instance, creating a prototype for the project, preparing for the presentation, and writing reports. Nonetheless, the delay that arose during this assignment forced us to remove some additional features and mechanics from the game such as story mode. In the future, we could make time to refine the prototype by adding a plot, rouge-like progression, more game levels and towers to create the first official version of the game.
    </p>

    <h3 class="aim">Scope and Limits</h3>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <h5>The Unity Game Engine</h5>
    <p>
        When it comes to a 2D game like ours, the Unity game engine is a perfect fit. Since its launch in 2005, Unity has become a house-hold name for game development, particularly in the indie scene. Unity offers a multitude of features especially relevant in our project such as sprite editing, animation, scripting,…. Alongside its beginner-friendly development interface, Unity’s wealth of community tutorials makes it a great place for novices like us to work on 4 the game. Therefore, we have chosen Unity as the primary development platform for the project.
    </p>
    <h5>Rogue-like Mechanics</h5>
    <p>Rogue-like games are role-playing games with heavy emphasis on replayability and difficulty. The most prominent feature of a rogue-like is how its challenging combat system makes players fail repeatedly, forcing them to adapt and improve their play-style after each failure. As with many other rogue-likes, defeat in our game is not the end. In fact, being defeated in a level offers the player a chance to improve their performance for future playing sessions in the home menu. During the adventure, players can collect gold coins, which can be spent to upgrade either the player’s character or the tower after the player has died in a level. After successfully clearing a level, the player is rewarded with various items to aid them in even harder levels. 
    </p>
    <h5>Player Movement and Combat</h5>
    <p>We, as a team, are huge fans of the 2D rogue-like genre. Therefore, our player combat and movement systems draw inspiration from classics like Enter the Gungeon, Hades, and The Binding of Isaac. For the movement system, we want to cultivate a sense of freedom and fluidity. Players should be able to explore the fantastic maps to their heart’s content. They will be able to move, run and dash through keyboard inputs (i.e. W, A, S, D keys and arrow keys). As for the combat system, we want players to immerse themselves through a fluid, responsive and natural style of input. With mouse inputs, our player combat system will have 360 degrees of freedom. This means the player will be able to fight, shoot, and use special skills in any direction they desire.
    </p>
    <h5>Weapons and Loot</h5>
    <p>
        Collecting powerful weapons and useful items to aid the adventurer in increasingly challenging levels is at the core of our game’s replayability. Therefore, it is important to have a wide variety of interesting and unique collectibles throughout the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Weapons are categorized into three main groups: melee, ranged and magic. Melee weapons are ones with relatively short range, but make up for it with high attack power. These weapons encourage an aggressive, high-risk-high-reward playstyle. Ranged weapons have lower damage but better range, which makes for a more tactical style of combat. Magic weapons are usually the most powerful, but players can only use them at the cost of mana, a fairly rare resource. 
Items come in a wide variety. These are collectibles meant to aid the player during combat. They include anything from health potions which heal the player, mana potions that restore player’s mana, bear traps that lock enemy movement, ... .
    </p>
    <h5>Enemies</h5>
    <p>The enemies have always been one of the most vital parts of a role-playing game. If done right, enemies can not only be a fun feature, but also form the basis of a game’s identity. Therefore, it is crucial to create an enemy system that pushes players to their limits, challenging them to keep honing their skills. In order to achieve this, we want to emphasize the enemies’ mechanics and variety. As for diversity, we expect different types of enemies to appear in the game. Thus, the experience of players throughout the game will not be boring, and this likewise contributes to the depth of lore in our game world. Besides, we find out that it is relevant to have the enemies ranked according to difficulties. We also focus on the design of each character, to give them unique features of the area they belong to. Overall, although the enemies’ strength lies not in intelligence but in numbers, forcing the player to utilize the tower mechanics to fight off monstrous hordes, we also pay attention to their combat mechanisms, managing to make them challenging enough, but not too overwhelming.  Hence, the game requires players to have not only a fine understanding of different enemy types, but also good skills and strategies.
    </p>
    <h5>Maps</h5>
    <p>Our game is heavily influenced by other top-selling 2D games on the market such as Hades, Vampire Survivors, Hotline Miami and Corekeeper. However, what these games have in common is top-down camera view. With this game’s perspective, the player will be able to see the entire content the map has to offer: what to look for, where the enemies are and the treasure locations. Our game utilized this camera technique to complement with a map layout inspired by Diablo II, where the player will have to survive in vast wildlands and explore the many dungeon’s floors. However, this will not turn the game into a casual, easy-mode RPG. Instead, your character will have to fight for their lives against the relentless hordes of monsters and undead alike in a large filthy swamp.</p>
    <h5>Towers</h5>
    <p>Roguelike RPG games are widespread among the gaming industry. That is why we decided to add a unique feature to stand out from the crowd which is towers. Taking inspiration from well-known tower defense games such as Kingdom Rush and Bloons TD, we design a number of built-in AI towers that can detect enemies that are in a specific range and damage them with a wide range of projectiles. This feature will be useful for the player to fight against the enemies that are slowly increasing in number as the level progresses. Additionally, there is a timer for each tower symbolizing the time that it is able to stay active. Therefore a maintenance and upgrade system is also added for the player to prevent the tower from deactivating. The purpose of this feature is to create a more engaging style of gameplay and 7 stimulate the player’s problem solving skills as there are now a variety of ways you can use your resources to beat the levels along with higher risks of losing as the difficulty increases.</p>
    <h4>Limits</h4>
    <p>Although it is great to be excited and ambitious for a project, we must keep expectations realistic and not inflate the game’s scope so as to avoid impossible deadlines. This is why we have set up clear points for what not to expect from our game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The project is not a full-fledged tower defense game. The tower mechanics in our game is simply a twist on the classic rogue-like genre, meant to make gameplay more unique. As such, many fundamental but irrelevant features of tower defense games like turn-based strategy and fixed enemy paths will be omitted.</li>
        <li> The game will not contain many original assets. Due to time restrictions, it is simply impossible to create enough original assets like images, animations and sounds for the game. Therefore, the project will rely heavily on copyright-free community assets.</li>
        <li>The map featured in our game will only be a mere battleground between player and enemies. Due to the lack of animated resources, it misses the interactive elements that other games have accomplished such as destructible objects (vases in Hades), teleportation gates (Dead Cells), weather and day/night cycle (Stardew Valleys).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unity Hub (Version 3.4.1): we also needed to install a Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.12f1) within this application</li>
        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 (Version 16.11.20)</li>
        <li>Github Desktop (Version 3.1.3)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>When creating a video game, it is extremely important to have extensive player testing to judge the playability, enjoyability and objective quality of the game. Therefore, we heavily emphasized testing with outsiders during development. Whenever basic mechanics like combat and towers get updated, we let our friends and family try out the game and record their response for further improvements. We are primarily looking for responses where people find the game fun, fluid and original.</p>
    <p>Within the time limit of the project, we could not carry out mass player testing, but that would be a more ideal condition for testing, thereby getting a more general and objective view of the game. Ideally, we would launch pre-release versions of our game on our own website, then get the responses of our players from there.    </p>
    <h4>Risks</h4>
    <h5>Technical Risks</h5>
    <h5>Software Risks</h5>
    <p>Unity might be popular [3] across the developer scene but popularity does not equate with doability. The problem first reveals to us when the main language for Unity is C#, not that we complain about the format but our adapting to Python has long been established.</p>
    <p>Another problem is resources. Unity does provide plenty of resources on the web page itself [4], but they do not fit with our needs as they are rather simple. Despite that, the Unity community has much more complex information for free that suits the project. However, the only problem is the information being outdated, some can be 3 years old [5]. And the imbalance of resources volume between 2D and 3D content that can be attributed to the respective popularity [6].</p>
    <p>Finally, some bugged features that we wish to add while making the game has been made obsolete only because there were no online solutions to address the problems. The elements that we have in the game come from various tutorials rather than one; theremore, compatibility without a doubt would arise. For example, we tried to aim the game to have a sense of soul-like where we would add darker theme around the map and a light following the player’s camera. However, it became completely unusable due to some core sprites we have are not compatible with a specific renderer. </p>
    <h5>The hardware risks</h5>
    <p>Most programmers and especially ones at the higher level should pay more attention to the generic risks that occur during using the computers such as crashes, slow connection and bad hardwares.</p>
    <p>Learning Unity can catch the conventional developer off guard with its huge versatile API libraries. Therefore, a faster internet connection is a requirement for better documentation, and speeds up the learning process.</p>
    <p>Sprites used for the on-working game can be hard to find and create, sometimes costly.</p>
    <p>Making a game with Unity requires different processes and can take up weeks before a project may be finished: collecting and creating assets, coding game’s algorithms for features, and rendering a playable game. However, the works done on Unity consume much more hardware specifications than one may imagine, a rendering of a 2048 x 2048 pixelated map using “Random walk technique” can take up 7 gigabytes of ram. Therefore, system’s crashes upon unsaved works are extremely fatal.</p>
    <h5>Human Risks</h5>
    <h6>Responsibility Risks</h6>
    <h6>Group Responsibility</h6>
    <p>The individual responsibility for participating in a group's intellectual sharing is of extreme importance towards a successful Unity’s project. Any failed attempt or a non-existent motivation to communicate is a step closer to the project failure.</p>
    <p>The teammates within a group may also become a huge jeopardy to the project’s success. Some may be inclined to progress anything on the group’s work or give up mid-way due to the apparent difficulty.</p>
    <h6>Individual Responsibility</h6>
    <p>As time-consuming a project may be, there are apparent health risks involved when working with a computer for hours. Furthermore, our group also found out that game development has already cost us a lot of health factors such as high amounts of sedentary work, excessive blue light exposure and late hours.</p>
    <p>Working on such a difficult project may tamper with the workflow of other courses which may result in deadline issues. However, the problem with deadlines will create various more hindrances such as health like mentioned above, low sociability and even low self-esteem in extreme cases.</p>
    <h4>Group’s Measurements against Risks</h4>
    <p>While discussing, the group has already expected and experienced the difficulty and what the repercussions may be for such a project. We also took the possible risks into consideration and are trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle to avoid any imbalance. However, making such moves is not only benificial to a student but also to a future developer. We take one saying to hearts dearly: “With great risks come great reward’’[7].</p>
    <h5>Solutions against software and hardware</h5>
    <p>For the problems with Unity, we have already found and shared among the group about the resources that can be used for the project available on Youtube and other platforms. And for hardware, having known that we would be more likely to work with video games and IT on a larger scale, each member has equipped themselves with adequate systems that can eliminate most of the generic risks.    </p>
    <h5>Solutions against “Human Risks”</h5>
    <p>To have a successful run in a project, we will have to prioritize both mental and physical health over other factors. And our group has achieved this by encouraging each other to have regular exercises through gym, clubs, and equipment available at RMIT facilities.</p>
    <p>And to tackle responsibilities, we are more inclined to have immediate solutions when problems arise rather than stack them up and solve them one by one. By far, team 17 has achieved adequate success in groupworks through many communication platforms mentioned in section 5.</p>
