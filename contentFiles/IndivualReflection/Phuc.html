    <h1>Tran Phan Trong Phuc</h1>
    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address:</strong> s3979081@rmit.edu.vn</li>
        <li><strong>Interest and skills:</strong> Phuc is the type of person who likes to create and learn new things.
            Along with an interest in technology, he has an internal motivation to do a variety of IT projects and can
            quickly grasp the knowledge and skills needed to make it happen.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Role:</strong> Phuc develops the tower system for the game. He is also responsible for managing the
            team’s timetable and the project’s progress. Therefore, he must also import those to our proposals and
            reports.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Career Plans:</strong> One of Phuc’s major goals in life was to utilize AI technology to improve
            human society. Therefore a career path in the AI industry specifically as an AI engineer would be an
            appropriate choice.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a young student who aspired to learn more about AI and its industry, I was blessed to have an opportunity to
        do a group project about information technology in this course. However, it was still a big challenge for me at
        the beginning as I did not have much knowledge to take on game development in comparison to my teammates – for
        example, how game development works?, how to use unity or code with C#?, etc. Surprisingly, with the helping
        hands of my smart teammates, I was still able to learn all these concepts and contribute to this project
        effectively. This journey really made me in awe of how powerful working in a team can be since our group has
        achieved so much in just a span of 3 months. Even though we have encountered many kinds of issues relating to
        ideas, insights, and technical problems, each member has put in the effort to solve every problem for the sake
        of the group, which is why I have so much respect for my teammates. This project has really helped me not only
        to bring me a step closer to my career path but also to grow as a person. In the future, I would embrace more
        opportunities to do group projects to see what else I can accomplish with this new-found knowledge and skills.
