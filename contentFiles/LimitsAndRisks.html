    <h1>Limits And Risks</h1>
    <h2>Limits:</h2>
    <p>
        Although it is great to be excited and ambitious for a project, we must keep expectations realistic and not
        inflate the game’s scope so as to avoid impossible deadlines. This is why we have set up clear points for what
        not to expect from our game:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The project is not a full-fledged tower defense game. The tower mechanics in our game is simply a twist on
            the classic rogue-like genre, meant to make gameplay more unique. As such, many fundamental but irrelevant
            features of tower defense games like turn-based strategy and fixed enemy paths will be omitted.</li>
        <li>The game will not contain many original assets. Due to time restrictions, it is simply impossible to create
            enough original assets like images, animations and sounds for the game. Therefore, the project will rely
            heavily on copyright-free community assets. </li>
        <li>The map featured in our game will only be a mere battleground between player and enemies. Due to the lack of
            animated resources, it misses the interactive elements that other games have accomplished such as
            destructible objects (vases in Hades), teleportation gates (Dead Cells), weather and day/night cycle
            (Stardew Valleys). </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <h3>Technical Risks:</h3>
    <h4>Software Risks:</h4>
    <p>Unity might be popular [5] across the developer scene but popularity does not equate with doability. The problem
        first reveals to us when the main language for Unity is C#, not that we complain about the format but our
        adapting to Python has long been established.</p>
    <p>Another problem is resources. Unity does provide plenty of resources on the web page itself [6], but they do not
        fit with our needs as they are rather simple. Despite that, the Unity community has much more complex
        information for free that suits the project. However, the only problem is the information being outdated, some
        can be 3 years old [7]. And the imbalance of resources volume between 2D and 3D content that can be attributed
        to the respective popularity [8].</p>
    <p>Finally, some bugged features that we wish to add while making the game has been made obsolete only because there
        were no online solutions to address the problems. The elements that we have in the game come from various
        tutorials rather than one; theremore, compatibility without a doubt would arise. For example, we tried to aim
        the game to have a sense of soul-like where we would add darker theme around the map and a light following the
        player’s camera. However, it became completely unusable due to some core sprites we have are not compatible with
        a specific renderer. </p>
    <h4>The hardware risks:</h4>
    <p>Most programmers and especially ones at the higher level should pay more attention to the generic risks that
        occur during using the computers such as crashes, slow connection and bad hardwares.</p>
    <p>Learning Unity can catch the conventional developer off guard with its huge versatile API libraries. Therefore, a
        faster internet connection is a requirement for better documentation, and speeds up the learning process.
        Sprites used for the on-working game can be hard to find and create, sometimes costly.</p>
    <p>Making a game with Unity requires different processes and can take up weeks before a project may be finished:
        collecting and creating assets, coding game’s algorithms for features, and rendering a playable game. However,
        the works done on Unity consume much more hardware specifications than one may imagine, a rendering of a 2048 x
        2048 pixelated map using “Random walk technique” can take up 7 gigabytes of ram. Therefore, system’s crashes
        upon unsaved works are extremely fatal.</p>
    <h3>Human Risks:</h3>
    <h4>Responsibility Risks:</h4>
    <h5>Group Responsibility:</h5>
    <p>The individual responsibility for participating in a group's intellectual sharing is of extreme importance
        towards a successful Unity’s project. Any failed attempt or a non-existent motivation to communicate is a step
        closer to the project failure.</p>
    <p>The teammates within a group may also become a huge jeopardy to the project’s success. Some may be inclined to
        progress anything on the group’s work or give up mid-way due to the apparent difficulty. </p>
    <h5>Individual Responsibility:</h5>
    <p>As time-consuming a project may be, there are apparent health risks involved when working with a computer for
        hours. Furthermore, our group also found out that game development has already cost us a lot of health factors
        such as high amounts of sedentary work, excessive blue light exposure and late hours.</p>
    <p>Working on such a difficult project may tamper with the workflow of other courses which may result in deadline
        issues. However, the problem with deadlines will create various more hindrances such as health like mentioned
        above, low sociability and even low self-esteem in extreme cases.</p>
    <h3>Group’s Measurements against Risks:</h3>
    <p>While discussing, the group has already expected and experienced the difficulty and what the repercussions may be
        for such a project. We also took the possible risks into consideration and are trying to maintain a healthy
        lifestyle to avoid any imbalance. However, making such moves is not only benificial to a student but also to a
        future developer. We take one saying to hearts dearly: “With great risks come great reward’’[9].</p>
    <h4>Solutions against software and hardware:</h4>
    <p>For the problems with Unity, we have already found and shared among the group about the resources that can be
        used for the project available on Youtube and other platforms. And for hardware, having known that we would be
        more likely to work with video games and IT on a larger scale, each member has equipped themselves with adequate
        systems that can eliminate most of the generic risks.</p>
    <h4>Solutions against “Human Risks”:</h4>
    <p>To have a successful run in a project, we will have to prioritize both mental and physical health over other
        factors. And our group has achieved this by encouraging each other to have regular exercises through gym, clubs,
        and equipment available at RMIT facilities.</p>
    <p>And to tackle responsibilities, we are more inclined to have immediate solutions when problems arise rather than
        stack them up and solve them one by one. By far, team 17 has achieved adequate success in groupworks through
        many communication platforms mentioned in section 5.
